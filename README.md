More Speeds Mod
=====
This mod adds an ability to change amount of game speeds and their values.
You can configure it in `config/more-speeds.json` file.
There should be at least one value, all values should be positive, and
they should be specified in descending order. 
Bellow you can see the comparison between vanilla speed values and values
from default mod config. The lower the value, the faster game time goes.
